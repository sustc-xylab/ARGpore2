last-postmask
=============

This script does post-alignment masking.  It reads pair-wise sequence
alignments, and writes only those that align a significant amount of
uppercase sequence.  (Lowercase is often used to indicate undesirable
repetitive regions.)

The input should be in MAF format, with header lines (of the kind
produced by lastal) describing the alignment score parameters.

The script discards alignments that lack any segment with score >=
threshold, when applying "gentle masking" of lowercase letters: this
means that the score for such a letter is min(unmasked score, 0).

The usage is simple::

  last-postmask in.maf > out.maf

It may be useful to feed the input from a pipe::

  ... | last-postmask > out.maf

Gentle masking is described in:

  Gentle masking of low-complexity sequences improves homology search.

Limitations
-----------

last-postmask does not (yet) handle sequence quality data,
frameshifts, or generalized affine gaps.
