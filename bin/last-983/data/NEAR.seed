# This DNA seeding scheme is good for finding short-and-strong
# (near-identical) similarities.  It is also good for similarities
# with many gaps (insertions and deletions), because it can find the
# short matches between the gaps.  (Long-and-weak seeding schemes
# allow for mismatches but not gaps.)
