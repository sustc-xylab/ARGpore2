# This subset seed is the default for protein UBLAST v8
# (http://drive5.com/usearch/).  According to the UBLAST website, it
# is good for typical medium- to low-identity protein searches.

# (The final position of UBLAST's pattern is omitted here, because it
# is the same as the first position, and LAST cyclically repeats the
# pattern.)
